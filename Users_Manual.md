Users Manual for LEDice

author: Paul Garten

The example implementation for a D6 works as follows:
In the configuration file, you will have to set the pins you are 
actually using and choose one method of depiction:

You can choose from either the traditional dice layout, a seven segment display, or binary.
For binary, you only need the first three pins, while for the other two, you will need all seven.

In "Dice_Setup.png", you can see how to setup the electronic components, 
in "Dice_Components.csv", you can see a list of all components used.

After configuration, you will just have to upload the program and you are set.
Press the button and the dice will roll!

IF you want to implement a new depiction method or else, 
see developer documentation for more information.
